## Solving the gap equation of the NJL model through iterations: unexpected chaos.
May. 2022 - Jul. 2022, Nankai University

Tianjin, China
- We explored the behavior of the iterative procedure to obtain the solution to the gap equation of the NLJ model for arbitrarily large values of the coupling constant.
- Solved the equation numerically with Mathematica to verify the emergence of chaos.
- Supervised by Prof. Lei Chang.
