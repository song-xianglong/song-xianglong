I am deeply fascinated by the marvelous         properties exhibited by elementary particles.          I am especially interested in          - Phenomenology of Quantum Chromodynamics;         - Particle physics experiments at high energy colliders;         - Detection of cosmic rays.          Since my freshman year, I have always been studying QCD phenomenology in Prof. [Lei Chang (\u5e38\u96f7)](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1029609)'s research group. I was a visiting student at [CMS group](https://www.roma1.infn.it/en/ricerca/csn1/cms.html) at Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma in my sophomore year, where I worked with Prof. [Let\u00edcia Cunqueiro](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/users/leticiacunqueiromendezuniroma1it). I worked on a small project about cosmic rays with Prof. [Gwenael Giacinti](https://tdli.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/people/t-d-lee-fellows/128/GwenaelGiacinti) at Tsung-Dao Lee Institute in my junior year. And I will collaborate on analysis on Higgs physics with Prof. [Caterina Vernieri](https://profiles.stanford.edu/caterina-vernieri) at SLAC during the second half of 2024."}]}
